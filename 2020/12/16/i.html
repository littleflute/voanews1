Moderna could get the green light as early as Friday, according to <i>The New York Times</i>, making millions of doses available to Americans within days.

The U.N. says over two million children in the Tigray region of Ethiopia have been cut off from humanitarian assistance for over a month.
<br><br>
UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore says the U.N. is prepared to provide essential services to [malnutrition] malnourished children in the embattled region but needs access to Tigray that Addis Ababa is currently not allowing.
<br><br>
Telecommunications have been cut and access limited to the Tigray region since violence broke out on November 4, making it difficult for humanitarian agencies to evaluate the needs there.
<br><br>
Since November, more than 50,000 people have fled violence in Tigray and headed to Sudan.

Journalists covering the first district elections to take place in Indian-controlled Kashmir since the government revoked the region's special status last year say the are being harassed and obstructed from reporting.
<br><br>
Media in the region were already facing challenges, including regulations imposed during the COVID-19 lockdown, limited Internet access, restrictive new media laws, arrests and harassment that have ramped up since India removed Article 370 from the constitution in August 2019, which granted autonomy to Kashmir.

Despite its declining population, the Associated Press has been told the monarch butterfly will have to wait to receive protection under the Endangered Species Act.  AP's Shelley Adler reports.
<br><br>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will consider the monarch butterfly a "candidate" for designation as threatened or endangered, but there are other species in line ahead of it.
<br><br>
Charlie Wooley, who is the head of the agency's Great Lakes regional office, says the monarch's status will be reviewed each year and emergency action could be taken earlier, but plans now call for proposing to list the orange and black butterfly in 2024.
<br><br>
Scientists estimate the monarch population in the eastern United States has fallen about 80 percent since the mid-1990s, while the drop-off in the western part of the country has been even steeper.

Lawmakers in Britain have proposed legislation that would fine social media companies if they do not quickly take action to remove illegal content like child pornography or terrorist materials.
<br><br>
U.S.-based Facebook and Twitter and China-owned TikTok could be fined up to 10 percent of turnover, according to Reuters.
<br><br>
Under the proposal, which will be introduced next year, social media companies must establish clear terms and conditions about content.
<br><br>
In addition to fines, some sites could be blocked from the British market if they fail to act.
