The United Nations is warning that tensions in Iraq could escalate after Monday's rocket attack in Erbil which killed a foreign contractor for the U.S. military and wounded at least 14 other people.
<br><br>
The hail of more than a dozen rockets late Monday was the first attack in nearly two months targeting Western military or diplomatic installations in Iraq after a series of similar incidents blamed on pro-Iranian Shiite factions.
<br><br>
The U.N.'s top representative in Iraq, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, wrote on Twitter, quote, "Such heinous, reckless acts pose grave threats to stability."
<br><br>
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier said he was "outraged" and pledged America's support in holding those responsible to account.
<br><br>
Iraq's prime minister said those who fired the rockets aimed to create chaos.  He vowed to keep Iraq from becoming a "backyard," in his word, where regional conflicts play out.  [...] The barrage of rockets used in Erbil were the same caliber as those fired in recent attacks in Baghdad.
<br><br>
They appeared to be aimed at military complex inside the Erbil [a...] airport.  The complex hosts foreign troops deployed as part of a U.S.-led coalition helping Iraq fight jihadists.
