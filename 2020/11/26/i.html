U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.  Flynn had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
<br><br>
A retired army general, Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about interactions he had with Russia's ambassador to the United States in the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, 2017.
<br><br>
He has since sought to withdraw the plea, arguing that prosecutors violated his rights.  His sentencing has been deferred several times.

<br><br>
Mr. Biden also appealed for unity in his address to the nation.
<br><br>
"... we're at war with the virus, not with one another.  Not with each other.  This is the moment where we need to steel our spines, redouble our efforts, and recommit ourselves to the fight.  Let's remember!  We're all in this together."
<br><br>

<br><br>
Tributes poured in from around the world, including pots on social media from Pele and Lionel Messi, wrote today is a sad day for all Argentinians and for football.
