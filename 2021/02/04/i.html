The head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that schools can safely reopen even if teachers do not get coronavirus vaccines.  AP's Sagar Meghani has details.
<br><br>
The CDC's vaccination plans prioritize teachers as essential workers but many have not gotten the shots yet.  Some teachers unions are refusing to allow in-person instruction to resume until they do.
<br><br>
But CDC Director Rochelle Walensky says that's not necessary.
<br><br>
"Vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite for the safe reopening of schools," saying data show social distancing and mask-wearing can significantly reduce virus spread in schools.
<br><br>
President Biden is pushing for nearly all K through 8 (K-8) schools to reopen in his first 100 days.

A new study appears to vindicate Britain's decision to delay the second virus vaccine dose.  AP correspondent Charles De Ledesma reports.
<br><br>
Health Secretary Matt Hancock says research showing a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca provides a high level of protection for 12 weeks supports the government's strategy of delaying the second shot so more doses can be delivered to more people.
<br><br>
Hancock's comments came after Oxford says there's evidence the vaccine cuts transmission of the virus by two-thirds and prevents serious disease.  The study has not been peer-reviewed yet but has been greeted with excitement by British officials under pressure to justify their decision to delay the second dose.

Police in Myanmar leveled their first formal charges against Aung San Suu Kyi, accusing her of possessing illegally imported walkie talkies and giving the military authorities who staged a coup a legal reason to detain her for two weeks.
<br><br>
The charge came to light two days after she was placed under house arrest and appeared to be an effort to lend a legal veneer to her detention though the generals have previously kept her and others locked up for years.
<br><br>
State Department spokesman Ned Price said the Biden administration is calling on Myanmar to release Suu Kyi and other dissidents.
<br><br>
"We call on the military to immediately release them all, and all the detained civilian and political leaders, journalists and detained human rights activists, and to restore the democratically elected government to power...."
<br><br>
The military announced Monday that it would take power for one year, accusing Suu Kyi's government of not investigating allegations of voter fraud in recent elections which her party overwhelmingly won.

A team of investigators working on behalf of the World Health Organization visited a major virus research laboratory in Wuhan, China, Wednesday.  Reuters Flora Bradley Watson reports.
<br><br>
Driving through thick morning mist, the team were bombarded by journalists' questions.
<br><br>
Scientist Peter Daszak is the president of the EcoHealth Alliance: "We're looking forward to meeting the key people here and asking all the important questions that need to be asked."
<br><br>
The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been the subject of several conspiracy theories.
<br><br>
"Did you find anything inside?"
<br><br>
Some claim that a leak from the lab caused Wuhan's first coronavirus outbreak at the end of 2019.  But most scientists reject that hypothesis.
<br><br>
There have, however, been calls for the lab to release details of all coronavirus samples studied there.
<br><br>
The WHO's field work will last two weeks and has already taken them to hospitals and several markets in the central Chinese city.
<br><br>
That's Reuters Flora Bradley Watson.

The Netflix movie "Mank" leads the film nominees for the Golden Globes with six including the best drama film.  "The Crown" leads the TV categories also with six.
<br><br>
Other multiple nominees include "The Trial of the Chicago 7," "Ozark" and "Nomadland."
<br><br>
The Golden Globes will be delayed two months because of the pandemic but they will still be the first major Hollywood award show.  They will be staged February 28, with Tina Fey hosting from New York and Amy Poehler in Los Angeles.
