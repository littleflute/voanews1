California Democratic Representative Ted Lieu said on Twitter Saturday that members of the House of Representatives will introduce formal articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on Monday.
<br><br>
At an afternoon news conference, Democratic Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Trump has to go one way or the other.
<br><br>
"It's my expectation that on Monday a privileged resolution will be introduced that will charge the president of the United States with inciting sedition."
<br><br>
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top congressional Democrat, has threatened to impeach Trump for a historic second time unless he resigns immediately following Wednesday's deadly riots at the Capitol.
<br><br>
Any impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, which is scheduled to be in recess until January 19 and has already acquitted Trump once before.
<br><br>
<br><br>
The man photographed smiling, carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lectern while a mob of President Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday is among dozens who have been arrested.  AP's Julie Walker reports.
<br><br>
Adam Johnson of Florida was arrested Friday night.  He was quickly IDed on social media and had posted "I'll be there."  The man who sat in Pelosi's office chair with his feet up, Richard Barnett of Arkansas, was also arrested as was the man dressed as a bare-chested Viking, Jake Angeli of Arizona, and Doug Jensen of Iowa, the man apparently seen on video leading a mob up the stairs chasing a lone officer who tried to hold them back.  Then there is West Virginia state lawmaker, Derrick Evans, who posted video online his bumping with a police officer.  He was arrested.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Seattle's interim police chief says two officers are on administrative leave and under investigation after being seen on social media there.

The incoming chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee is calling the Capitol a "crime scene" with evidence that needs to be preserved.  AP's Ben Thomas reports.
<br><br>
Senator Mark Warner has written 11 telecommunication and social media companies asking them to immediately preserve content and associated meta-data connected to the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol.  Those companies include mobile carriers AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon and from the social media world - Apple, Facebook, Gab, Google, Parler, Signal, Telegram and Twitter.
<br><br>
Warner says the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are trying to piece together what happened and messaging data to and from those companies' subscribers could be critical evidence in bringing rioters to justice.

An official with Indonesia's national search and rescue agency confirms that debris from a Sriwijaya Air passenger plane carrying 62 people was found after contact was lost shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.  We get more from Reuters Adam Reed.
<br><br>
The plane from Sriwijaya Air and flying to the neighboring island of West Kalimantan took off about 2:30 p.m. local time and then disappeared off radar screens.
<br><br>
The flight tracking service, Flightradar24, says the plane appears to have lost (more than)10,000 feet of altitude in less than a minute.  It was raining when the plane took off.
<br><br>
The plane is a Boeing 737-500 model, which is 27 years old, much older than the troubled 737 Max model.  It was a 737 Max that crashed off Jakarta two years ago, killing 189 people.
<br><br>
That's Reuters Adam Reed.

The Taliban warned Saturday that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's resolve to remain in office until the completion of his tenure is detrimental to peace talks aimed at finding a negotiated end to four decades of war in Afghanistan.  But the Afghan president in an apparent rebuttal has repeatedly vowed that he is legally bound to transfer power to his "elected successor."
<br><br>
The insurgent group's warning came on a day when its leaders held fresh discussions in Qatar with representatives of the Ghani government on developing "a joint agenda" for what are officially known as intra-Afghan negotiations to encourage a political settlement to the war and bring American forces home.
<br><br>
<br><br>
A persistent blizzard that blanketed large parts of Spain with an unusual amount of snow on Saturday has killed at least four people and trapped thousands in cars or at train stations and airports.
<br><br>
In Madrid, authorities activated the red alert for the first time since the system was adopted four decades ago and called in the military to rescue people in vehicles.
