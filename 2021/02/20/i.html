U.S. President Joe Biden has urged all Americans to get the COVID vaccine when it becomes available to them, insisting that the shots are safe.  AP's Sagar Meghani reports.
<br><br>
After touring a Pfizer vaccine plant in Michigan, the president hailed what he called the vaccine miracle, saying there should be enough doses for all Americans by July.
<br><br>
"I believe we will be approaching normalcy by the end of this year."
<br><br>
But he warns there will be bumps.  "Look what's happening with the weather now for example.  It's slowing up the distribution ...."
<br><br>
With some vaccine sites closed, the government held back roughly six million doses.
<br><br>
"... about three days of delayed shipping ...."
<br><br>
White House virus response adviser Andy Slavitt expects the backlogs to be cleared within a week.  But he says vaccine sites will have to work overtime to get back on track.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Leaders of the Group of Seven economic powers promised Friday to immunize the world's neediest people against the coronavirus by giving money and precious vaccine doses to a U.N.-backed vaccine distribution effort.
<br><br>
But the leaders, under pressure over their vaccination campaigns at home, were not willing to say exactly how much vaccine they were willing to share with the developing world or when.
<br><br>
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said after the G-7 leaders held a virtual meeting that fair distribution of vaccines was "an elementary question of fairness."
<br><br>
But she added, "No vaccination appointment in Germany is going to be endangered."
<br><br>
After their first meeting of the year held remotely because of the pandemic, the leaders said they would "accelerate global vaccine development and deployment" and support "affordable and equitable access to vaccines" and treatments for COVID-19.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in his first news conference as Pentagon chief said Friday that progress toward peace in Afghanistan and an end to U.S. military involvement there depends on the Taliban reducing attacks.
<br><br>
But Austin said that there would be no hasty withdrawal of the about 2,500 troops in Afghanistan.
<br><br>
"I told our allies that no matter what the outcome of our review, the United States will not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan that puts their forces or the alliance's reputation at risk."
<br><br>
Austin, a retired four-star Army general who oversaw U.S. forces in Afghanistan and across the Middle East for three years during the Obama administration, said the Biden administration is "methodically and deliberately" assessing its next steps in Afghanistan, where U.S. troops have been present for nearly 20 years.

A young woman protester in Myanmar who was shot in the head last week as police dispersed a crowd died on Friday, the first death among opponents of the February 1 coup.  Reuters Libby Hogan reports.
<br><br>
Twenty-year-old Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing had been on life support since she was taken to hospital after she was hit by what doctors said was a live bullet at a protest.
<br><br>
She is the first person to be killed since Myanmar's army seized power on February 1.
<br><br>
Police moved on in different protests across the country Friday.  Baton-wielding officers were seen running at anti-coup protesters in northern Kachin State in the city of Myitkyina.
<br><br>
In Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, police barricaded its largest protest site.  A witness said hundreds of people gathered at the barricades anyway, while a procession of several thousand gathered at another point.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on Myanmar's ruling generals
<br><br>
That's Reuters Libby Hogan.

The power is back on in most of Texas but now the attention has shifted to the tens of thousands of homes and businesses without water.  AP's Tim McGuire reports.
<br><br>
Texas Governor Greg Abbott says home and business owners across the state face a major problem in the wake of the winter storm, power outage and deep freeze.
<br><br>
"...busted water pipes ...."
<br><br>
The governor says the call for help has gone out to retired plumbers.
<br><br>
"Over 320 plumbers have renewed their license."
<br><br>
Abbott adding that state officials have also asked for help from other states.
<br><br>
Officials say home and business owners need to contact their insurance companies and make sure that those hired to make the repairs are requitable.
