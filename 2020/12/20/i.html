U.S. President Donald Trump has made his first comments about a widespread data breach across the U.S. government downplaying the seriousness and impact of the cyber espionage campaign.  AP's Ben Thomas reports.
<br><br>
In a pair of tweets, President Trump suggests without evidence that China, not Russia, may be responsible for the attack.
<br><br>
In the stressed comment on the breach, Trump scoffed at the focus on the Kremlin downplayed the intrusions though the government's cyber security agency has warned they pose a "grave" risk to government and private networks, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that Russia was pretty clearly behind the cyberattack.
<br><br>
It's not clear exactly what the hackers were seeking, but experts say it could include nuclear secrets, blueprints for advanced weaponry, COVID-19 vaccine research, or information for dossiers on government and industrial leaders.

President-elect Joe Biden on Saturday rolled out an environmental team that he hopes will steer America toward greater action to curb climate change and to protect the nation's air and water.
<br><br>
The president-elect told reporters as he introduced his choices that there was literally no time to waste.  Biden compared the climate threat to the calamity of the coronavirus pandemic and pledged to take action.
<br><br>
"Just like we need to be (a) unified nation that responds to COVID-19, we need a unified national response to climate change.  We need to meet the moment with the urgency it demands, as we would during any national emergency."
<br><br>
The approach is a shift from Donald Trump's presidency, which has been marked by efforts to boost oil and gas production while rolling back government efforts intended to safeguard the environment.

Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Christmas gatherings can't go ahead and non-essential shops must close in London and much of southern England as he imposed a new, higher level of coronavirus restrictions on the region to curb spreading infections.  AP's Zaria Shaklee reports.
<br><br>
Johnson said that the capital and other areas in southern England currently under Tier 3, the highest level of coronavirus restrictions, will move to an even stricter new Tier 4 that requires all non-essential shops, hairdressers and indoor leisure venues to close.
<br><br>
Johnson also said that a planned five-day easing of socializing rules for Christmas will be canceled for Tier 4 areas.
<br><br>
"In England, those living in Tier 4 areas should not mix with anyone outside their own household at Christmas."
<br><br>
No mixing of households will be allowed except under very limited conditions outside in public places.

The army general in charge of getting COVID-19 vaccines to the United States is apologizing for what he calls "miscommunication" with states over the number of doses delivered in the early stages of the rollout.  AP's Julie Walker reports.
<br><br>
General Gus Perna says that's not happening with the newest vaccine.
<br><br>
"Distribution of Moderna vaccine has already begun."
<br><br>
It's scheduled for rollout Sunday with Monday arrival across the country.  As for states not getting the amount of Pfizer vaccine they expected, he says that was his "planning error."
<br><br>
"I failed.  I am adjusting.  I am fixing and we will move forward from there." 
<br><br>
General Perna says with addition of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine to Pfizer's, the government is now on track to get about 20 million doses to states by late December or early January.
