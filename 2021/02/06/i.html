President Joe Biden says the U.S. economy is in trouble and he is again laying out the case for moving ahead with his coronavirus relief package.  AP's Sagar Meghani has details.
<br><br>
The government's latest jobs report shows hiring has stalled.  Hundreds of thousands have left the labor force.
<br><br>
The president says a lot of folks are losing hope.
<br><br>
"... so I'm going to act and I'm going fast" and alone if need be.
<br><br>
The president's increasingly calling out Republicans for pitching a relief bill far smaller than the $1.9 trillion he's seeking.  He says that'll force Americans to wait too long for help and it may end up being too late.
<br><br>
"I'm going to help the American people who are hurting now."
<br><br>
Both the Senate and House have now taken the first steps toward approving the package with no GOP backing.

The Pentagon will deploy troops to assist getting Americans vaccinated against COVID-19.
<br><br>
White House coronavirus senior adviser Andy Slavitt announced Friday that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has approved a request for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  Slavitt says the first active duty troops will help deliver vaccinations next week in California.
<br><br>
"The military's critical role in supporting sites will help vaccinate thousands of people per day and that ensure every American who wants a vaccine will receive one."
<br><br>
The move means that about 1,000 active duty military personnel will deploy to help state vaccination centers.
<br><br>
President Joe Biden has called for setting up 100 mass vaccination centers around the country within a month.

Judges at the International Criminal Court on Friday found the court has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in the Palestinian territories, paving the way for a possible criminal investigation despite Israeli objections.
<br><br>
The decision prompted swift reactions from Israel, which is not a member of the court and rejects its jurisdiction, and the Palestinian Authority, which welcomed the ruling.
<br><br>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said "the court is ignoring the real war crimes and instead is pursuing Israel."
<br><br>
The ICC judges said their decision was based on the fact that Palestine has been granted membership to the tribunal's founding treaty, and had referred the situation to the court.  The judges said the jurisdiction decision does not imply any attempt to determine Palestinian statehood, which is uncertain, or national borders.

Myanmar's new military rulers ordered mobile operators and Internet service providers to block access to Twitter and Instagram in the country until further notice, according to the Norwegian telecom Telenor.
<br><br>
The military blocked access to Facebook on Thursday, prompting thousands of social media users in the country to join Twitter.
<br><br>
Earlier Friday, hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Myanmar's capital as the military expanded its dragnet against ousted officials.
<br><br>
In the largest protests since Monday's military coup, protesters at Myanmar University and Yangon University demanded that the military hand power back to Myanmar's elected officials.

Christopher Plummer, the dashing award-winning actor who played Captain von Trapp in the film "The Sound of Music" and at 82 became the oldest Academy Award acting winner in history, has died.  AP's Ed Donahue reports.
<br><br>
Plummer was best known for playing Captain von Trapp in 1965 "The Sound of Music."
<br><br>
But Plummer considered it a mediocre performance and was not a fan of "The Sound of Music" even while filming it.
<br><br>
"I kept reminding everybody all the time how gooey and sentimental and yucky it was."
<br><br>
In 2012, he made history, at 82 becoming the oldest Oscar-winning actor at the 84th Academy Awards.
<br><br>
"You're only two years older than me darling, where have you been all my life?"
<br><br>
Plummer said after accepting the award, "I hope I can do it for another ten years at least, I'm going to drop dead wherever I am - on stage or on set.  We don't retire in our profession, thank God."
<br><br>
His manager says Christopher Plummer died at his home in Connecticut.
