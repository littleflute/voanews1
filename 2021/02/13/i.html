U.S. senators have been questioning attorneys for former President Donald Trump and Democratic House managers in the former president's second impeachment trial.  AP's Sagar Meghani has more.
<br><br>
The defense says House prosecutors manipulated the then president's words to backers in the speech before the attack.
<br><br>
Lawyer Michael van der Veen says yes, Trump did tell them to fight like hell but so what?  Politicians have said that for centuries.  And he showed a video of Democrats doing the same.
<br><br>
"Spare us the hypocrisy and false indignation."
<br><br>
But van der Veen ignored that the president's remarks that day and for weeks before were aimed at mobilizing backers to undermine an election he falsely claimed was stolen.
<br><br>
Democrats like Mazie Hirono argued the president knew exactly what he was doing.
<br><br>
"He had to have known there would be violence ... and he just lit the match."
<br><br>
In an evenly divided Senate, Trump is all but certain to be acquitted in a vote as soon as tomorrow.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that in-person schooling can resume safely with masks, social distancing and other strategies.  We get more from AP's Ed Donahue.
<br><br>
Schools can reopen using familiar practices - social distancing, hand-washing, mask-wearing.
<br><br>
"We know that most clusters in the school setting have occurred when there are breaches in mask wearing."
<br><br>
CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky says teacher vaccination is important but not necessary.
<br><br>
"The science has demonstrated that schools can be reopened safely prior to all teachers being vaccinated."
<br><br>
Walensky points out they are using stronger languages but these are recommendations.  Each school district is different.
<br><br>
"And I can assure you that this is free from political meddling."
<br><br>
The president of the National Education Association says the CDC guidance is good but schools are failing to meet it.

Supporters of ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi clashed with police Friday as hundreds of thousands joined nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations.  Reuters Maha Albadrawi reports.
<br><br>
Pro-democracy protesters in Myanmar clashed with police on Friday, leaving three wounded after police fired rubber bullets to break up a crowd in a southeastern town.
<br><br>
Friday's mostly peaceful nationwide demonstrations marked the seventh consecutive day of protests and the biggest so far.
<br><br>
Hundreds of thousands of people marched across Myanmar, denouncing the military coup and defying the junta's call to halt mass gatherings.
<br><br>
They carried placards, staged dance-offs, and demanded freedom.
<br><br>
In Yangon, they plucked the roots off bean sprouts in a symbolic move to show their intention to "cut off" the country's military roots of governance.
<br><br>
That's Reuters Maha Albadrawi.

The search is on for a replacement for 2020 Olympics chief Yoshiro Mori, who resigned on Friday and apologized over sexist comments.  Reuters Matthew Larotonda has more.
<br><br>
Mori apologized, again, and stepped down at a meeting on Friday.
<br><br>
"The important thing is for the Olympics to be held in July and in order to hold the Olympics, if my presence is a hindrance to the preparations, this cannot be allowed."
<br><br>
The former Japanese prime minister started the controversy when he said that women talk too much when he led a meeting earlier this month.
<br><br>
He initially refused calls for his resignation and apologized at the time, but the pressure became too much after a second sexist remark.
<br><br>
It's not immediately clear who will replace him.
<br><br>
Mori's resignation comes just months before the postponed Summer Games are scheduled to begin.
<br><br>
That's Reuters Matthew Larotonda.

Aid workers are warning a sharp drop in temperatures across parts of northern Europe this month has put homeless and vulnerable people at serous risk.  AP's Charles De Ledesma reports.
<br><br>
German homeless aid group BAGW says four people have been found frozen to death since a blast of Arctic air brought freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall to much of the country while authorities in the southern city of Nuremberg say a homeless woman was found with a newborn baby in temperatures well below freezing.  They were taken to a hospital to warm up and for observation.
