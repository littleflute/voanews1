U.S. President Donald Trump is spending the holiday weekend at his Florida resort as both Democrats and Republicans wait to see whether he will sign a critical pandemic relief and government funding package that he sharply criticized earlier this week.
<br><br>
The legislation which includes $892 billion for coronavirus relief was flown from Washington to the president's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida for him to sign into law, but the president surprised lawmakers in both parties by labeling the legislation a "disgrace."
<br><br>
Mr. Trump said the package gave too much money to special interests and foreign aid, and said direct payments of $600 for most Americans should be increased to $2,000.
<br><br>
A partial federal government shutdown looms early Tuesday if Mr. Trump does not sign the bill.  Congress is planning to return to work Monday and could take up a stopgap measure to extend government funding.
