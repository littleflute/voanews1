U.S. security officials say they are taking every precaution to guard against an attack on President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration Wednesday as [pre...] preparations for the day continue.

Guatemalan forces used tear gas and batons Monday to break up a group of Honduran migrants near the border who were hoping to travel to the United States.
<br><br>
Roughly 2,000 migrants had camped out at a roadblock for nearly two days.  Some threw stones at Guatemalan forces that were attempting to disperse the crowd, prompting them to use tear gas and batons.

Some Hondurans have reportedly agreed to be bused back across the border, diminishing the original group of nearly 8,000.
