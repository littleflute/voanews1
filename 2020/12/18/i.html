A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recommended emergency use of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine.  We get more from AP's Mike Gracia.
<br><br>
The COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna and the National Institutes of Health has been endorsed by a panel of advisers for the Food and Drug Administration.
<br><br>
Dr. Melinda Wharton of the CDC took part in Thursday's debate.
<br><br>
"I strongly support the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals ..."
<br><br>
The Moderna vaccine showed 94 percent protection against COVID-19 in the company's ongoing study of 30,000 people.  Like the Pfizer vaccine, a second shot is required.  But unlike the Pfizer vaccine, Moderna's does not need ultra cold storage.
<br><br>
FDA Emergency Use Authorization for the Moderna vaccine is expected soon.

U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres on Thursday appealed to rich nations to support the purchase of coronavirus vaccines for poor countries and to refrain from hoarding the doses for themselves.
<br><br>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Germany's foreign minister, Guterres said he is appealing to rich nations not to hoard the doses.
<br><br>
"We need to be able to make vaccine available [everybo...], to everybody, everywhere, and affordable by everybody, everywhere."
<br><br>
Guterres warned that it is in all countries' interests to ensure broad immunization because, in his words, "nature always strikes back."
