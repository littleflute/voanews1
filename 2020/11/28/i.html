One of Iran's top nuclear scientists was killed Friday when his vehicle was attacked not far from the capital, Tehran.  Edward Yeranian reports from Cairo.
<br><br>
Iranian TV broadcast video of the road where top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh's vehicle came under attack.  Other video showed a helicopter reportedly transporting Fakhrizadeh and other injured people to a hospital.
<br><br>
Some reports said that explosives went off before gunmen fired into the windshield of the vehicle Fakhrizadeh was riding in.
<br><br>
Iranian media blamed Israel for the attack on Fakhrizadeh.  Social media also showed a 2018 video of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu detailing alleged facets of Iran's nuclear program before mentioning Fakhrizadeh and calling him a "name to remember."
<br><br>
Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack.

At least seven people were killed in a huge bomb blast in Mogadishu, Somalia, Friday just hours after U.S. acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller made an unannounced visit to the Somali capital.
<br><br>
Witnesses say a suicide bomber blew himself up at Gelato Devino, a popular ice cream shop along the road to the airport.
<br><br>
One of Mogadishu's ambulance services said at least seven people were killed in the attack.  Somali police said another 10 people were wounded.
<br><br>
The al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab extremist group claimed responsibility for the bombing, according to the SITE Intelligence Group.  Al-Shabab frequently carries out attacks in Mogadishu as part of its bid to overthrow the Somali government and impose its strict interpretation of Islamic law.

President Donald Trump's legal team suffered yet another defeat in court Friday as a federal appeals court in Philadelphia roundly rejected its latest effort to challenge the state's election results.  AP's Ben Thomas has more.
<br><br>
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals echoed a string of other courts in finding the Trump campaign offered no evidence of any election fraud in Pennsylvania, declaring "the campaign's claims have no merit."
<br><br>
During five hours of oral arguments in a lower court last week, Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani insisted there was widespread fraud in Pennsylvania but failed to offer any tangible proof.
<br><br>
U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann described the campaign's error-filled complaint as "haphazardly stitched together" like Frankenstein's monster.
<br><br>
The 3rd Circuit called Brann's ruling justified.  All three judges on that panel were appointed by Republican presidents.

Britain has asked its regulator on Friday to assess AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine for a possible rollout, while the Philippines and Thailand secured millions of doses.  We get more from Reuters Emer McCarthy.
<br><br>
The UK government, which has secured 100 million doses of the vaccine has targeted a rollout to begin before Christmas.
<br><br>
AstraZeneca's candidate is viewed as offering one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures.
<br><br>
The Thai government signed a deal on Friday to procure 26 million doses of the vaccine, and officials in the Philippines said they would secure 2.6 million shots and were negotiating a possible purchase of a further 1 million doses.
<br><br>
The announcements came after some scientists raised doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90 percent effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose.
<br><br>
That's Reuters Emer McCarthy.

Germany has hit another grim milestone in the coronavirus pandemic, ticking above 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19.  AP correspondent Zaria Shaklee reports.
<br><br>
The country's disease control center said that Germany's 16 states reported nearly 23,000 cases overnight for a total since the start of the outbreak of over million cases.
<br><br>
Despite the high number of infections, Germany has seen fewer deaths than many other European countries, with nearly 16,000, compared with more than 50,000 in Britain, Italy and France, for example.
<br><br>
A rapid response to the initial outbreak, massive testing and a robust hospital system have been credited with helping keep the fatalities down.
