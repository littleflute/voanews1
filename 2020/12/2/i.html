The United Nations is pleading with Ethiopia to allow aid to reach refugee camps in Tigray, where nearly 100,000 people from (neighbor)ing Eritrea are thought to have run out of food.
<br><br>
At a news briefing, the UNHCR's Babar Baloch says Ethiopia should give "urgent access" to teams so that they can reach the refugees in the area.
<br><br>
"Our concerns are growing by the hour.  The camps will now have run out of food supplies - making hunger and malnutrition a real danger."
<br><br>
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered troops in the Tigray on November 4 following alleged attacks by [Tigray's People Liberation Front] Tigray People's Liberation Front forces on federal military camps in the northern region.
<br><br>
Abiy claimed victory on Saturday.

An ad(visory panel for) U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities should be prioritized in the first phase of COVID-19 vaccinations.
<br><br>

After being summoned to the White House for a meeting about vaccine development, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn says officials will take the time needed to, quote, "(get this) right."

The FDA is weighing whether to authorize the Pfizer and Moderna experimental vaccines.
<br><br>
Hahn says everyone is working really hard to look at these applications and get this done.  But they have to do this the right way.
<br><br>
President Trump has frustrated that vaccine approval is taking so long and it was a sign of the pressure Dr. Hahn is under that the FDA offered guidance that he remains the FDA commissioner.

China has announced its robot probe launched to return lunar rocks to Earth has landed on the moon.  AP's Charles De Ledesma has more.
<br><br>
The official China news agency says the Chang'e-5 probe has "successfully landed" on the moon in the pre-selected landing area.
<br><br>
The one-sentence report gave no more details, though.
<br><br>
Plans call for the robot lander to drill into the lunar surface and load over 4 pounds of rocks and debris into an orbiting vehicle and return them to Earth for analysis.
<br><br>
The probe launched November 24 from a tropical island in the south of China adds to a string of increasingly bold missions by a Chinese space program that aims eventually to land a human on the moon.
