Most of California might soon be under a coronavirus stay-at-home order.  The AP's Ed Donahue has details.
<br><br>
Governor Gavin Newsom says this was expected,  "... the final surge in this pandemic."
<br><br>
A record number of people are in California hospitals.  "Regions where the ICU capacity is falling below 15 percent, we are now mandating that we are implementing a stay-at-home order for three weeks."
<br><br>
Newsom says four out of the five regions in California could reach that threshold soon.  Hair saloons, bars and casinos would close.  Retail stores would be at 20 percent capacity and only takeout at restaurants.
<br><br>
"There is light at the end of the tunnel.  We are a few months away form truly seeing real progress with the vaccine."
<br><br>
A Republican lawmaker accused Newsom of disrupting daily life without releasing details behind the decisions.

The Trump administration says some Americans could be just days away from getting a coronavirus vaccine.  But there are fears some people might not want it.  AP's Sagar Meghani reports.
<br><br>
"Health is on the way."
<br><br>
Vice President Pence says vaccinations may start within 48 hours of federal regulators approving the drugs - what he calls historically fast progress "only in America."
<br><br>
But Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Robert Redfield worries about a culture in America.  "This growing concern over what I call vaccine hesitancy."
<br><br>
Some people just don't trust them.  "It's really sad as an infectious disease physician to see many people choose to leave vaccination on the shelf."
<br><br>
Former Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama say they'd be willing to publicly take a coronavirus vaccine to boost confidence.

The U.N. secretary-general said Thursday the damage COVID-19 has done globally will not be undone by a vaccine and a full recovery will take years, if not decades.
<br><br>
Ant&oacute;nio Guterres was speaking to a high-level special session of the General Assembly intended to take stock of the current global response to the illness caused by the coronavirus.
<br><br>
"We face the biggest global recession in eight decades and these inter-generational impacts are not due to COVID-19 alone.  They are the result of long-term fragilities, inequalities and injustices that have been exposed by the pandemic.
<br><br>
Nearly 80 heads of state and government are addressing the two-day summit by video, which will also include presentations from scientists, experts and the heads of several U.N. agencies, including the director-general of the World Health Organization.

Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai was denied bail on Thursday.  Reuters Flora Bradley Watson has details.
<br><br>
Lai and two of his senior executives are facing a charge of fraud relating to the lease of a building that houses Lai's <i>Apple Daily</i>, an anti-government tabloid.
<br><br>
Authorities have intensified a crackdown on key opposition figures in the Chinese-ruled city following Beijing's imposition of a national security law on June 30.  The new law punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.
<br><br>
Lai and his colleagues are accused of falsely representing the use of their office to their landlord.
<br><br>
While the fraud charge does not fall under the new law, the case marks another crackdown on pro-democracy figures.
<br><br>
Lai's appearance in court came just a day after one of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, Joshua Wong, was jailed for more than 13 months for his role in an unlawful anti-government rally in 2019.

President Trump's effort to challenge his election defeat in Wisconsin has been rejected by the state's highest court.  AP's Jackie Quinn reports.
<br><br>
The Wisconsin Supreme Court voted 4 to 3 in its refusal to hear President Trump's lawsuit attempting to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the battleground state.
<br><br>
The justices weren't ruling on the merits of the case.  It was the process, ordering that it be heard first in the lower courts.
<br><br>
The president's attorney citing the December 14 date for presidential electors to cast their votes had been seeking a speedier process.
<br><br>
Two of the justices questioned whether Trump's request to disqualify tens of thousands of ballots would be the right remedy if there had been irregularities.  But another justice says the court is obligated to determine if elections officials complied with the law.
