President Donald Trump can be heard on tape pleading with the U.S. state of Georgia's election chief to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state.  AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports.
<br><br>
In an audio recording obtained by the Associated Press of a call Saturday between the president, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and others, the president says "I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state and flipping the state is a great testament to our country."
<br><br>
In the call, Trump repeats a litany of claims of alleged voter fraud and irregularities, to which Raffensperger responds "Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong."
<br><br>
Biden's senior adviser Bob Bauer calls the recording "irrefutable proof" of Trump pressuring and threatening an official in his own party to overturn the election.
