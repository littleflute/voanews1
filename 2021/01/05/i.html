British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered England to lockdown in an attempt to slow the surge in new COVID-19 cases.  Here he is in a televised address on Monday evening.
<br><br>
"With most of the country already under extreme measures, it's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out."
<br><br>
The prime minister stressed the rising cases and a new more contagious variant threatened to overwhelm parts of the [ho...] health system.  He said that if the timetable of the vaccination program went as planned and the number of cases and deaths responded to the lockdown measures, the country could start moving out of lockdown in the middle of February.
