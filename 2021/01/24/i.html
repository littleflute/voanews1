Russian police arrested more than 3,000 people Saturday in nationwide protests calling for the release of leading opposition leader Alexei Navalny.  AP's Sarah Bassett reports.
<br><br>
The protests stretched across Russia's vast territory where some demonstrators took to the streets in temperatures as low as minus-58 Fahrenheit.  The range shows how Navalny and his anti-corruption campaign have built a network of support despite government ....
<br><br>
Navalny's wife Yulia was among those arrested.
<br><br>
Navalny was arrested this week after returning to Moscow from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin, which Russian authorities deny.
<br><br>
The 44-year-old activist is known for his reports on corruption within Russian President Vladimir Putin's government.

Portuguese voters, largely confined to their homes due to a strict COVID-19 lockdown, will pick a new president Sunday.  As Reuters Edward Baran reports, some fear going to the polls could worsen a surge in coronavirus cases.
<br><br>
The country of 10 million people, which fared better than others in the first wave of the pandemic, now has the world's highest seven-day rolling average of new cases and deaths per million people.
<br><br>
Almost two-thirds of voters think the election should be postponed.  That's acco(rding to a) recent poll.
<br><br>
Delaying the ballot would have required changing the country's constitution - something officials said was not possible at such short notice.
<br><br>
But there has been widespread criticism of the decision to press ahead with the vote for the largely ceremonial president.
<br><br>
Pollsters expect record-high abstentions.
<br><br>
Voluntary teams clad in protective gear are collecting ballots at the doorsteps of some 13,000 quarantined voters, and about 250,000 people have registered for early voting to avoid crowds.
<br><br>
That's Reuters Edward Baran.

Democrats are planning to move quickly on an elections bill in the new Congress.  AP's Ben Thomas has details.
<br><br>
States have long had disparate and contradictory rules for running elections. and Democrats in the House and Senate say national rules are needed to shore up American democracy, especially after a tumultuous post-election period and the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol.
<br><br>
The For the People Act would establish federal election standards, mandating early voting, same day registration and other voting rights for forms.  It would also put the job of drawing congressional districts in the hands of independent commissions and obligate presidents to disclose their tax returns.
<br><br>
Republicans are calling it federal overreach.

Legendary broadcaster Larry King died Saturday at the age of 87, according to his official Twitter account.  Earlier in the month, Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles said he was battling COVID-19.  AP's Julie Walker reports.
<br><br>
King's death at an LA deputy was confirmed on his Twitter account.  He'd been battling COVID but earlier in the month, his spokesman said he'd been moved from ICU.
<br><br>
King was a radio host before moving to CNN where he interviewed everyone from President Obama to Lady Gaga to the Dalai Lama.
<br><br>
In 1994, he described his interview style to AP.  "What you got to do with people is take them into a comfort zone.  If you can make someone comfortable, you own them."
<br><br>
He also said the idea for wearing suspenders came from a former wife.  "... so I put my one and people started calling and saying it look good and that so it's stuck."
<br><br>
Larry King is survived by three sons and a very large extended family.
