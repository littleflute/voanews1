U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi spoke to lawmakers Sunday about the efforts to remove President Donald Trump from office.  The speaker said the House would first vote on a resolution this week, calling on Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment.  If not, the House will move toward impeachment.

Five people died, including a Capitol Hill police officer who was involved in a scuffle with protesters.
