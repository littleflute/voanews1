Hopes for a first wave of coronavirus vaccinations before the end of 2020 received a boost as another drug maker says it's ready to ask U.S. and European regulators to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine.  AP's Mike Hempen has more.
<br><br>
Moderna is asking regulators to allow emergency use of its vaccine as new study results confirm the tests offer strong protection.  Moderna's vaccine has been created with the National Institutes of Health.
<br><br>
Results from over the weekend suggest the vaccine is more than 94 percent effective.
<br><br>
Moderna says the shots' effectiveness and a good safety record so far - with only temporary, flu-like side effects - mean the vaccine meets the requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use before the final-stage testing is complete.
<br><br>
I'm Mike Hempen.
<br><br>
<br><br>
If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration agrees Moderna's product is safe and effective, the first of the drug's two doses could be given to millions people by the middle of December.

U.S. President-elect Joe Biden is continuing a push toward diversity as he rolls out administration appointments.  AP's Sagar Meghani has more.
<br><br>
Biden's announcing his senior economic key highlighted by former Fed chair Janet Yellen who would be the nation's first female treasury secretary.
<br><br>
He is also tapping Neera Tanden to lead the Office of Management and Budget.  She would be the first woman of color in that post as would Cecilia Rouse, a top White House's Council of Economic Advisers.  Biden's picked her to chair the council.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says the Tigray region's dissident leaders have fled west of the regional capital after weeks of fighting.  Reuters David Doyle has more.
<br><br>
A triumphant Abiy Ahmed praised the troops in Ethiopian parliament on Monday for their victory in the country's northern Tigray region even as the forces he claims to have defeated said they were still fighting.
<br><br>
His soldiers captured Tigray's capital Mekelle at the weekend, prompting a declaration that a military operation in the region was completed.
<br><br>
Abiy said they had carried out a "special surgery" in Mekelle and not destroyed the city nor killed a single civilian in the region.
<br><br>
But in a conflict where information has been difficult to verify, the rebellious Tigrayan People's Liberation Front has a different version of events.  It says Mekelle suffered heavy bombardment.  It also says the war is far from over and claims to have shot down a plane and retaken a town.
<br><br>
That is Reuters David Doyle reporting.
<br><br>
<br><br>
A top Iranian security official says Israel used "electronic devices" to remotely kill a military nuclear scientist.  AP's Charles De Ledesma has the story.
<br><br>
Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the country's Supreme National Security Council, drastically changes the story of Friday's slaying of the nuclear scientist.
<br><br>
Authorities have initially said a truck exploded and then gunmen opened fire.
<br><br>
A state TV Arabic language channel claims the weapons used were "controlled by satellite," a claim also made Sunday by the semiofficial Fars news agency.
<br><br>
None of the outlets immediately offered any evidence supporting their claims.
<br><br>
Israel has declined to comment on the attack.

Britain and the European Union are warning each other that time was running out to reach a Brexit trade deal, with big differences still to be bridged on state aid, enforcement and fishing.
<br><br>
Britain leaves the EU's orbit on December 31, when a transition period of informal membership ends following its formal departure last January.
<br><br>
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says a deal would be preferable but that Britain would flourish without one.

Merriam-Webster has announced its annual word of the year.  AP's Oscar Wells Gabriel has more.
<br><br>
The editor at large for Merriam-Webster says the choice of "pandemic" probably is not going to be a big shock, not only is it a technical term for a widespread outbreak of disease but it's become a mainstream word in 2020.
<br><br>
Pandemic first began trending online in January.  It really took off in March after the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus as a pandemic.
<br><br>
Searches for pandemic that day alone were 1,15,806 percent higher than those for the same date a year ago.
