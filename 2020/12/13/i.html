U.S. government officials say the first COVID-19 vaccines will begin arriving in states Monday morning.  We get more from AP's Julie Walker.
<br><br>
General Gustave says he expects the first shipments to arrive Monday, with more over the following two days.
<br><br>
"Within the next 24 hours, they will begin moving vaccine from the Pfizer manufacturing facility to the UPS and FedEx hubs, and then it will go out to the 636 locations nationwide."
<br><br>
Perna knows they won't be enough initial doses to vaccinate Americans for herd immunity.
<br><br>
"We know that we are not done."
<br><br>
Though skeptical of the coronavirus vaccinate, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn says they didn't cut corners, just red tape.
<br><br>
"I know the meticulousness of the review that the FDA has done.  I will absolutely take this COVID-19 vaccine."

South Korea reported a record 950 daily coronavirus cases on Saturday, exceeding the late February peak of 909.  Reuters Emer McCarthy reports.
<br><br>
President Moon Jae-in has ordered the mobilization of police, military personnel and public medical doctors in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
<br><br>
The surge has been a blow to South Korea's pandemic-fighting system, which used invasive tracing, testing and quarantine to suppress previous waves without lockdowns, keeping daily infections below 50 for much of the summer.
<br><br>
The third wave comes despite tougher social-distancing rules that took effect on Tuesday, including unprecedented curfews on restaurants and most other businesses.
<br><br>
That's Reuters Emer McCarthy.

U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres has urged world leaders to declare states of climate emergency in their countries to spur action to avoid catastrophic global warming.
<br><br>
Guterres said that economic recovery packages launched in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic represented an opportunity to accelerate the transition to a low carbon future but he warned this was not happening fast enough.
<br><br>
"Carbon dioxide levels are at record highs.  Today, we are 1.2 degrees hotter than before the industrial revolution.  If we don't change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3 degrees this century."
<br><br>
About 70 heads of state and government took part in the meeting, which was organized by Britain, the U.N. and France.  It took place on the fifth anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement.

French riot police dragged and arrested demonstrators in Paris who were protesting against police violence and a security bill on Saturday.
<br><br>
Parisians and press freedom activists took to the streets to protest against the draft law, which sets out to increase its surveillance tools and restricts rights on circulating images of police officers in the media and online.
<br><br>
Protesters say the bill would also restrict civil liberties and would infringe journalists' freedom in the country.
<br><br>
France has been hit by a wave of street protests after the government introduced the security bill in parliament.
