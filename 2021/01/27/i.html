[From] For the first time since his inauguration, U.S. President Joe Biden spoke Tuesday with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, expressing concerns about the arrest of dissident Alexei Navalny, Moscow's cyber-espionage campaign and bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan, two senior Biden administration officials described the call on Tuesday.
<br><br>
According to U.S. accounts of the call, Biden told Putin that Russia and the United States should complete a five-year extension of their nuclear arms control treaty before it expires in early February.
<br><br>
Russian has not yet commented on the call but Moscow announced Tuesday that Russia and the United States have struck a deal to extend the New START nuclear arms control treaty.  The Biden administration has not confirmed this.
<br><br>
Biden told reporters Monday that despite disagreements with Moscow he believes both countries can operate in mutual self-interest on a New START agreement.  He said that plan does not need to conflict, with making clear to Russia that the United States is very concerned about other issues on which the countries are in opposition.
<br><br>
Mr. Biden also spoke Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, where he reassuring him of the United States' commitment to NATO.  NATO is the West's post-World War II military pact that was formed as an alliance against the threat of Russian aggression.
<br><br>
The two calls are a stark contrast with the attitudes of the previous administration.  Former President Donald Trump was often deferential to Putin while quarreling with his NATO allies.
<br><br>
And aides [of] of Navalny called Tuesday for new anti-government rallies in Moscow this weekend.  The opposition figure's team hosted an event on Facebook calling for his supporters to gather in Moscow at noon Sunday.

The U.S. Senate has confirmed Antony Blinken to be the secretary of state, paving the way for the Biden administration's eventual reversal of the Trump administration's isolationist policies.
<br><br>
Blinken was confirmed by a 72-22 vote to serve as the country's top diplomat, filling the most senior Cabinet position and one that is fourth in the line of presidential succession.
<br><br>
At a confirmation hearing last week, Blinken said he is ready to confront the challenges posed by China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.  He said China "poses the most significant challenge" to U.S. national interests, while noting there is room for cooperation.
<br><br>
Conservative lawmakers' opposition to Blinken centered on concerns that he may help the new administration reenter the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and that he would halt former President Donald Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against the Middle Eastern power.
<br><br>
He also pledged to rebuild State Department morale and the diplomatic corps.  Blinken said he sees U.S. standing abroad as leadership based on, quote, "humility and confidence."
<br><br>
The [50-year...] 58-year-old was deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration and has close ties with President Biden.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Israel's army chief said Tuesday he had ordered that plans be drawn up to counter Iran's nuclear capabilities in the event of a political decision to target [is...] the Islamic republic.
<br><br>
Chief of Staff General Aviv Kochavi said he had instructed the military "to prepare several operational plans in addition to existing ones throughout the coming year."  He added that the power to initiate them lies with the Israeli government.
<br><br>
Iran, Israel's arch foe, agreed in 2015 to a deal on its nuclear program with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.  The deal offered sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on Tehran's nuclear ambitions and guarantees it would not seek an atomic bomb.  Iran maintains that it has only pursued a civilian nuclear energy program.
<br><br>
Israel always opposed the deal and in 2018 then U.S. president Donald Trump unilaterally pulled Washington out of it and reimposed crippling sanctions in a "maximum pressure" campaign against Tehran.
<br><br>
In response, Iran has stepped back from key nuclear commitments, leaving the deal hanging by a thread even as new U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has signaled it wants to salvage the agreement.
<br><br>
<br><br>
And the acting U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations has reaffirmed the Biden administration's commitment to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians and said it [slowly helps] helps to slowly build shattered confidence between the two sides.
