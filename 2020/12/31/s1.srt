A new vaccine will be rolled out in Britain with a focus on quick mass protection. Britain's health department said it was authorizing emergency use of the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. AP's Karen Chammas reports.

3
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:30,908
<br>The approval and a shift in policy will speed up rollout of the vaccine in the U.K. which comes as a surge in infections threatens to swamp British hospitals.

00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:35,636
Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the vaccine brings light at the end of the tunnel.

5
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:48,038
"I am now, with this approval this morning, highly confident that we can get enough vulnerable people vaccinated by the spring that we can now see a route out of this pandemic."

00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:55,708
Coronavirus vaccines have typically been given in two doses, with an initial shot followed by a booster about three weeks later.

7
00:00:55,797 --> 00:01:09,633
But in a change of approach, the British government said with the AstraZeneca vaccine it would prioritize giving as many people as possible a single dose, which is believed to give a large measure of protection against the virus.<br><br>Karen Chammas, London.

00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:17,653
<br>Scientists say they have a lot to learn about the new variants of the coronavirus but prevention remains the key. AP's Jackie Quinn reports.

00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:26,360
Now that the variant moving through England has been detected in the U.S., people are wondering does it spread more quickly and if they might get even sicker.

A former CDC official says there are nearly two dozen mutations of the coronavirus already. There are still a lot of changes to see if they might trigger more severe illness.

11
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:46,465
<br>A virus expert at the University of Cambridge says the variant there could be two times more infectious than the earlier strain and that is causing concern.

12
00:01:46,555 --> 00:02:01,675
While it's not uncommon for viruses to mutate, experts are concerned if the mutations change the proteins on the virus surface, it could make immune from antibody's in drugs.<br><br>I'm Jackie Quinn.<br>
